*At this stage, the script would only run for Unix systems*

## How do I run the script?
**Run the script via the command line with the following syntax**
`python FindDuplicates.py --root_dir='PATH'`

#### clarifications;
- `PATH` **needs** to be replaced with the required directory to operate the script on
- `PATH` *can* be replaced `'.'` if the current directory is the required one.
- `python` can be replaced with `python3`
