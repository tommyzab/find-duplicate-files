*The script is compatible with every OS*

## How do I run the script?
**Run the script via the command line with the following syntax**
`python FindDuplicates.py --root_dir='PATH'`

#### clarifications;
- `PATH` **needs** to be replaced with the required directory to operate and execute the script.
- `PATH` *can* be replaced with `.` if the current directory is the required one.

#### extra modules:
- `tqdm` - presents the progress while running the program (not necessary for execution, can be edited out).
